Short for Yet Another Parachain.

**Note:**
This is an experiment and expect fail in the end. I only commit a few hours per week to this project.

## Overview

It's known that building a parachain is hard, from dev to market. This repository is aimed to show people how to launch a "profitible" parachain without issue a new token. Building it in the public means,

- every line of code is open sourced
- decisions and thought process are listed
- feedbacks from others will be considered
- metrics like user growth, revenue, etc. will be shared
