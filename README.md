Short for Yet Another Parachain.

**Note:**
This is an experiment and expect fail in the end. I only commit a few hours per week to this project.

## Overview

It's known that building a parachain is hard, from dev to market. This repository is aimed to show people how to launch a "profitible" parachain without issue a new token. Building it in the public means,

- every line of code is open sourced
- decisions and thought process are listed
- feedbacks from others will be considered
- metrics like user growth, revenue, etc. will be shared

## Day 0

What to build?

As blockchain is mostly useful for transactional systems, so I need to first find what's is valuable enough to setup such a transactional system. 
- money is valuable in general sense, but too much money printed in paper or crypto way as of now
- people is valuable, find the correct people can be tough for a lot of cases, like business partners, co-workers, etc.
- knowledge is valuable, in words, audio, video, music, art, etc. We have too much information in this digital-verse, filter the right one is hard.
- health is valueable, but people offen ignore it before getting sick. It'll be helpful to ask your family and friends to supervise your excersise, eat healthy, etc.
- kindness is especially valueable in group and community, but it's hard to measure and reward.

I will start from *people*, the first job for this parachain is to help people to find the right people.
